    "The quantum phase estimation algorithm is used to estimate the phase of a given operator U. Specifically, the problem statement is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a unitary transformation $U$ on $n$ qubits and $|\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenvector of $U$ with eigenvalue $e^{2\\pi i\\phi}$ where $0 \\le \\phi \\le 1$. Consider that $U$ or $|\\psi\\rangle$ or $e^{2\\pi i\\phi}$ is not explicitly known but instead control-$U^{2^j}$ operations can be performed where $j \\in \\mathbb{R}: 0 \\le j$. Also, assume that a single preparation of the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given. The problem is to obtain an m-bit estimator of $\\phi$."
