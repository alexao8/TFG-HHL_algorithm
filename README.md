# TFG-HHL_algorithm
This repository contain the documentation and code of the Bachelor's thesis of Alex Aleman. This thesis studies the HHL algorithm and implements it using Qibo, an open-source python framework.

## Files in this repository

#### qft.py
the qft.py file is the file that defines the Quantum Fourier Transform. Given a number that is the number of qubits, this file returns the circuit of the QFT when executed.


#### qpe.py
the qpe.py file is the file that defines the Quantum Phase EStimation. Given a number that is the number of qubits, this file returns the circuit of the QPE when executed. This circuite uses the Quantum Fourier Transform.
